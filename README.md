# Satella Jailed

For, um, educational purposes only or something. Definitely *don't* use this to pirate in-app purchases in apps to which you don't have legal rights.

A modern in-app purchase cracker built for sideloaded applications, especially on unjailbroken devices. If you want to crack in-app purchases on jailbroken devices, including for sideloaded apps, try [Satella 2][1]

## Usage
1. Download Satella.dylib from here
2. Obtain a **decrypted** .ipa of your target app
3. Patch the .ipa to include Satella.dylib
4. Sideload the patched .ipa to your device
5. Attempt to make an in-app purchase, then cancel on the popup

Alternatively:
1. Link your device to [AppDB][2] 
2. Enable the in-app purchase patch and install an app
3. Attempt to make an in-app purchase, then cancel on the popup

You can also access Satella Jailed’s preferences by long-pressing with two fingers inside an app. By default, receipts and observer are disabled.
