Now you can make fake purchases without a jailbreak! Just attempt to purchase something and cancel on the popup. 

You can also access Satella Jailedâ€™s preferences through a floating button with the Satella logo. This only works on iOS 14-15.

The configurable options are:
- Enabled: Enable or disable all features of Satella Jailed.
- Receipt: Spoof receipts for purchases. This works well on iOS 12-13, not so much on 14-15.
- Observer: Replace the appâ€™s transaction observer with a hacked one
- Hide Forever: Hide the Satella button until you delete/reinstall the app
- Apply: Gives options to hide the Satella logo, close the app (i.e., apply your changes), or view Satella Jailedâ€™s source code.
